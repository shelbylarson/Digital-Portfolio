				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p><b>My participation in Dev.Catalyst:</b></p>
				<p>I have participated in Dev.Catalyst for the past 3 years. While I was in Web Design my sophomore year, I created a website that won 3rd place that year and earned the privilege of going to San Francisco. Last year, I particapted in Dev.Catalyst while in Programming and Logic I. I created an iOS app for filtering photos. This year, I collaborated with the 4 other people in my Programming and Logic II class to build a Raspberry Pi project. Lastly, I created another iOS app this year, which I hope will win an award :) <br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelby-larson-854124ba"> View my LinkedIn profile</a></p>

						<h4><strong><a href="https://github.com/shelbylarson/Photo-Filter-Swift-App">77Share</a>              </strong> iOS app</h4>
						<span class="lieu">12/2/15</span>
						<span class="dates"></span>
						<p>77Share is an app that combines filtering photos and being able to share them with other people. The two 7's stand for the 7 filters that you can use and being able to use them to access all 7 colors of the rainbow. When you run the app, you MUST first add a picture to begin the filter process. To do this, click the camera icon in the top right corner. From there, you can choose any photo from your camera roll to add a filter to. Once you have decided on a photo, click on it. The picture you chose will come up on a screen to confirm that is the right image; if so, select "Choose", and if not, select "Cancel", which will take you back to your camera roll to choose a different photo. Once you click the "Choose" button, you will go to a new screen where you can begin filtering your image. You can use the preset one that automatically shows up, or you can change the filter by selecting the "Change Filter" button. From there, you can pick any one of the 7 filters. To adjust the intensity of the filters, use the slider located at the bottom of the screen. When you have your photo filtered just the way you like it, click "Share". From here, you can complete multiple different actions to share this image with whomever you like. You can share it via e-mail, iCloud Photo Sharing, or any social media apps that you have on your device. You can also save it to your camera roll, aassign it to a contact, and copy or print it.

						<h4><strong><a href="https://github.com/shelbylarson/Artist-Business-Website">Matthew                 Watkins | Artist </a></strong> website</h4>
						<span class="lieu">12/2/14</span>
						<span class="dates"></span>
						<p>This website was the second website I ever created. I made it for a local artist who                 wanted to get his name out in Jackson. On the home page, there is a brief greeting and a photo which is responsive, just like the rest of the site. The menu buttons change their appearance when you hover over them. In the footer on every page is a logo that I designed for this website. The About page is simply a page that includes information about the artist. The Gallery page includes photos of Matthew's artwork. When you hover over the pictues, they expand to a rectangular shape and the color of the border changes. On the References page, there is a responsive table with contact information to speak with Matthew's references. The Contact the Artist page includes a responsive form that can be used to contact the artist. Finally, the Services and Prices page has an interactive table which reveals the price of the items when you hover over them.</p>
